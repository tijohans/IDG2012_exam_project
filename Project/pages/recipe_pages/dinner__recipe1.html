                <p>first things first let's get a
                    pot of water on the burner and just
                    bring that up to a boil for the pasta</p>
                <p>next i'm gonna get a pan on a burner
                    preheating on a low heat i'm gonna dice
                    up an onion nice and small so it cooks
                    quickly and i'll dump in a good bit of
                    olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan</p>
                <p>and there's really not many ingredients
                    so a high quality olive oil is really
                    going to help you out </p>
                <p>so i'll throw the
                    onions into the pan and start sweating
                    them down </p>
                <p>and in the meantime i'll chop
                    up some garlic and generally i'll just
                    slice it because it's quicker and i find
                    that it's a little easier to protect
                    from burning when you've got those
                    bigger chunks </p>
                <p>i'll toss that in with the
                    onions and cook everything down for a
                    few minutes
                </p>
                <p>so i'm just sweating the onions and
                    garlic you can see i'm not really
                    getting too much color but that is a lot
                    of flavor </p>
                <p>now a lot of things are about
                    to happen </p>
                <p>salty dump in these tomatoes
                    whole they'll pop they'll stew down
                    put a lid on that so they start to break
                    down
                </p>
                <p>now my water is boiling
                    so i've got some penne here use whatever
                    you want throw that in there i'm
                    guessing that's like seven or eight
                    minutes </p>
                <p>12 to 14 minutes that seems aggressive
                    this is a pretty vigorous
                    boil i don't think it's going to take
                    that long if it does we're already
                    breaking rules so i'm going to keep my
                    eye on that
                </p>
                <p>i'm going to keep my eye on
                    that in the meantime i'm going to chop
                    up some parsley you can use basil if you
                    want </p>
                <p>and some parmesan so typically i
                    would microplane the parmesan right into
                    the pasta but i don't have one right now</p>

                <p>yeah good not good so let's take a peek
                    here so those tomatoes look amazing and</p>

                <p>typically i would take like a potato
                    masher but i only have a few tools right
                    now in this kitchen so let's see like
                    this might work and i just want to smash
                    it's really going to speed up the process
                </p>
                <p>typically i would take like a potato
                    masher but i only have a few tools right

                    this might work and i just want to smash
                    it's really going to speed up the process
                </p>
                <p>so sweet already incredible that's why i
                    love those cherries a little bit more
                    salt cracked pepper can i do this with
                    one hand</p>
                <p>not very well check in on the pasta
                    cooking away so that was like 10 minutes
                    and this is definitely al dente so watch
                    how this comes together </p>

                <p>this is looking
                    amazing even though that's reduced a lot
                    totally fine because we're going to add
                    a lot of liquid right now pasta right
                    into sauce</p>


                <p>just a little bit of that for now now we
                    really want the noodles to suck up that
                    sauce and to create a creaminess with
                    all of that extra starch like right now
                    that's looking a little bit weak noodles</p>
                <p>
                    look a little bare take a little more of
                    this create more sauce let that reduce
                    and get thick
                </p>
                <p>okay now we'll get that cheesy in there
                    a little more pasta water
                    now it's looking so much kbetter when</p>
                <p>
                    it's at that point we'll add the fresh
                    you can use basil too a little water to
                    just thin it out a bit transformation</p>
                <p>bon appetit</p>
