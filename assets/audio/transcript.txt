first things first let's get a
pot of water on the burner and just
bring that up to a boil for the pasta

next i'm gonna get a pan on a burner
preheating on a low heat i'm gonna dice
up an onion nice and small so it cooks
quickly and i'll dump in a good bit of
olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan

and there's really not many ingredients
so a high quality olive oil is really
going to help you out 

so i'll throw the
onions into the pan and start sweating
them down 

and in the meantime i'll chop
up some garlic and generally i'll just
slice it because it's quicker and i find
that it's a little easier to protect
from burning when you've got those
bigger chunks 

i'll toss that in with the
onions and cook everything down for a
few minutes

so i'm just sweating the onions and
garlic you can see i'm not really
getting too much color but that is a lot
of flavor 

now a lot of things are about
to happen 

salty dump in these tomatoes
whole they'll pop they'll stew down
put a lid on that so they start to break
down 

now my water is boiling
so i've got some penne here use whatever
you want throw that in there i'm
guessing that's like seven or eight
minutes 

12 to 14 minutes that seems aggressive 

this is a pretty vigorous
boil i don't think it's going to take
that long if it does we're already
breaking rules so i'm going to keep my
eye on that 

i'm going to keep my eye on
that in the meantime i'm going to chop
up some parsley you can use basil if you
want 

and some parmesan so typically i
would microplane the parmesan right into
the pasta but i don't have one right now

yeah good not good so let's take a peek
here so those tomatoes look amazing and

typically i would take like a potato
masher but i only have a few tools right
now in this kitchen so let's see like
this might work and i just want to smash
it's really going to speed up the process

i'll turn that down to very low
i'm telling you that took no time and i
mean that looks pretty damn good to me i
don't even have a spoon to try i'm using
the spatula

so sweet already incredible that's why i
love those cherries a little bit more
salt cracked pepper can i do this with
one hand

not very well check in on the pasta
cooking away so that was like 10 minutes
and this is definitely al dente so watch
how this comes together 

this is looking
amazing even though that's reduced a lot
totally fine because we're going to add
a lot of liquid right now pasta right
into sauce

just a little bit of that for now now we
really want the noodles to suck up that
sauce and to create a creaminess with
all of that extra starch like right now
that's looking a little bit weak noodles

look a little bare take a little more of
this create more sauce let that reduce
and get thick 

okay now we'll get that cheesy in there
a little more pasta water
now it's looking so much kbetter when

it's at that point we'll add the fresh
you can use basil too a little water to
just thin it out a bit transformation
