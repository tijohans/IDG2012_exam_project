Maybe you only got two minutes and you wanna make a cookie.

00:01.000 --> 00:05.000 A:middle T:50% 
First thing we're gonna do, are we're gonna take 
some softened butter, kinda get it in here.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000 A:middle T:50% 
This is more about those times you get those cravings
and you don't want like 10 cookies,

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000 A:middle T:50% 
but you just want something sweet that'll hit those spots.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000 A:middle T:50% 
Add in some brown sugar.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000 A:middle T:50% 
And then you wanna mix this
until it's essentially a smooth paste.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000 A:middle T:50% 
So next is your wet ingredients.
You're gonna take your egg and your vanilla
and just kinda go in.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000 A:middle T:50% 
It's essentially the same steps
as making a normal chocolate chip cookie

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000 A:middle T:50% 
except you're just dealing with smaller amounts.
I didn't say this was gonna be the easiest thing to make,

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000 A:middle T:50% 
but it beats having to whisk
a whole giant bowl of this stuff.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000 A:middle T:50% 
After that, flour.
No matter how many times I make chocolate chip cookies,

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000 A:middle T:50% 
I always end up spilling.
Going with some salt and some chocolate chips.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000 A:middle T:50% 
You actually wanna save a handful
because we're gonna decorate the top of the cookie

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000 A:middle T:50% 
to have more chocolate on top.
So the rest go inside.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000 A:middle T:50% 
It looks like chocolate chip cookie dough.
That's because it is.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000 A:middle T:50% 
Oh, yeah, that's good.
You want a plate that is pretty large,

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000 A:middle T:50% 
like a normal dinner plate, some parchment as well
because the parchment is gonna help

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000 A:middle T:50% 
prevent the cookie from sticking.
And we're gonna scoop a nice big scoop of cookie dough

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000 A:middle T:50% 
because, man, this stuff's good.
All right, kinda like that.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000 A:middle T:50% 
'Cause you also wanna decorate the top
with a little bit more chocolate.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000 A:middle T:50% 
And the key here is to actually clump them together.
When it starts to cook, and you'll see this,

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000 A:middle T:50% 
it'll start to spread.
It's like studding a watch with jewelry,

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000 A:middle T:50% 
except the diamonds crunch chocolate chips.
I'm gonna say that this cookie

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000 A:middle T:50% 
contains a lot of the drip
as I've heard in some of the songs.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000 A:middle T:50% 
This is gonna go in for about a minute and 30 seconds
and we're gonna see how it goes.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000 A:middle T:50% 
Looks pretty nice.
He looks like a nice old chocolate chip cookie.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000 A:middle T:50% 
Almost like the clip art version.
I'm gonna peel this off.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000 A:middle T:50% 
It's a nice chewy little cookie we have over here.
This is your 2-Minute cookie

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000 A:middle T:50% 
which is done in the microwave,
which I think is pretty awesome.
